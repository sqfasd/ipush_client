 * How often to send a ping.
 *
 * The internal timer fires every (pingInterval / 4) seconds.
 * Upon firing it checks when data was last received from the target,
 * and sends a ping if the elapsed time has exceeded the pingInterval.
 * Thus the effective resolution of the timer is based on the configured interval.
 *
 * To temporarily disable auto-ping, set the interval to zero.
 *
 * The default pingInterval is 60 seconds.
