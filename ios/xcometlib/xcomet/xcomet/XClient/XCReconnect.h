 * As opposed to using autoReconnect, this method may be used to manually start the reconnect process.
 * This may be useful, for example, if one needs network monitoring in order to setup the inital xmpp connection.
 * Or if one wants autoReconnect but only in very limited situations which they prefer to control manually.
 *
 * After invoking this method one can expect the class to act as if an accidental disconnect just occurred.
 * That is, a reconnect attempt will be tried after reconnectDelay seconds,
 * and the class will begin monitoring the network for changes in reachability to the xmpp host.
 *
 * A manual start of the reconnect process will effectively end once the xmpp stream has been opened.
 * That is, if you invoke manualStart and the xmpp stream is later opened,
 * then future disconnections will not result in an auto reconnect process (unless the autoReconnect property applies).
 *
 * This method does nothing if the xmpp stream is not disconnected.

 * Stopping the reconnect process does NOT prevent future auto reconnects if the property is enabled.
 * That is, if the autoReconnect property is still enabled, and the xmpp stream is later opened, authenticated and
 * accidentally disconnected, this class will still attempt an automatic reconnect.
 *
 * Stopping the reconnect process does NOT prevent future calls to manualStart from working.
