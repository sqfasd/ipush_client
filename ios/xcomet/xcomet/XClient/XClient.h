// * This method is called immediately prior to the stream being secured via TLS/SSL.
// * Note that this delegate may be called even if you do not explicitly invoke the startTLS method.
// * Servers have the option of requiring connections to be secured during the opening process.
// * If this is the case, the XMPPStream will automatically attempt to properly secure the connection.
// *
// * The dictionary of settings is what will be passed to the startTLS method of the underlying GCDAsyncSocket.
// * The GCDAsyncSocket header file contains a discussion of the available key/value pairs,
// * as well as the security consequences of various options.
// * It is recommended reading if you are planning on implementing this method.
// *
// * The dictionary of settings that are initially passed will be an empty dictionary.
// * If you choose not to implement this method, or simply do not edit the dictionary,
// * then the default settings will be used.
// * That is, the kCFStreamSSLPeerName will be set to the configured host name,
// * and the default security validation checks will be performed.
// *
// * This means that authentication will fail if the name on the X509 certificate of
// * the server does not match the value of the hostname for the xmpp stream.
// * It will also fail if the certificate is self-signed, or if it is expired, etc.
// *
// * These settings are most likely the right fit for most production environments,
// * but may need to be tweaked for development or testing,
// * where the development server may be using a self-signed certificate.
// *
// * Note: If your development server is using a self-signed certificate,
// * you likely need to add GCDAsyncSocketManuallyEvaluateTrust=YES to the settings.
// * Then implement the xmppStream:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler: delegate method to perform custom validation.

// * Allows a delegate to hook into the TLS handshake and manually validate the peer it's connecting to.
// *
// * This is only called if the stream is secured with settings that include:
// * - GCDAsyncSocketManuallyEvaluateTrust == YES
// * That is, if a delegate implements xmppStream:willSecureWithSettings:, and plugs in that key/value pair.
// *
// * Thus this delegate method is forwarding the TLS evaluation callback from the underlying GCDAsyncSocket.
// *
// * Typically the delegate will use SecTrustEvaluate (and related functions) to properly validate the peer.
// *
// * Note from Apple's documentation:
// *   Because [SecTrustEvaluate] might look on the network for certificates in the certificate chain,
// *   [it] might block while attempting network access. You should never call it from your main thread;
// *   call it only from within a function running on a dispatch queue or on a separate thread.
// *
// * This is why this method uses a completionHandler block rather than a normal return value.
// * The idea is that you should be performing SecTrustEvaluate on a background thread.
// * The completionHandler block is thread-safe, and may be invoked from a background queue/thread.
// * It is safe to invoke the completionHandler block even if the socket has been closed.
// *
// * Keep in mind that you can do all kinds of cool stuff here.
// * For example:
// *
// * If your development server is using a self-signed certificate,
// * then you could embed info about the self-signed cert within your app, and use this callback to ensure that
// * you're actually connecting to the expected dev server.
// *
// * Also, you could present certificates that don't pass SecTrustEvaluate to the client.
// * That is, if SecTrustEvaluate comes back with problems, you could invoke the completionHandler with NO,
// * and then ask the client if the cert can be trusted. This is similar to how most browsers act.
// *
// * Generally, only one delegate should implement this method.
// * However, if multiple delegates implement this method, then the first to invoke the completionHandler "wins".
